# Graph DB 

A C/C++ implementation of a general purpose graph database system. 

## The Idea 
Got the idea to write this after having played around with several graph databases out there. The object of this database system is to be fast, ACID, be able to work both on a filesystem and memory and easily deployable. This is at its very early stages of development and I do it on my free time so bare with me. Any suggestions, critics and comments are always welcome. Contributions are also very welcome feel free to fork and do pull requests. 

## Requirements
This will compile on Linux and Mac OS for the time being. Windows would also be a good idea but once the project matures a bit more and gets contributors. 

## Compilation
Only tests are available at this time. You will find makefile_test in the graph folder. It's also the folder where the sources are located. Cd into the graph folder and do:

    $ make -f makefile 

This will create the build folder where you will find the newly generated executables which test the currently implemented functionalities

## Current functionalities
Quite a bit was done. Need to fill this part out at some point!

## TODO
### Tons to go
Will fill this one out as well in due time.
